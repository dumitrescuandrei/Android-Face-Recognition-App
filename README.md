# Android-Face-Recognition-App
A friend's Raspberry Pi device had a camera and a switch connected to it. Using Python, it would recognize whether a human face had appeared in front of the camera and it would recognize that instance as an attempt to unlock an imaginary door mechanism (represented by the switch). The attempt would be sent to Firebase and the application from this repository would receive the latest entry to the Firebase database and render it on the main page of the application.

In addition to the aforementioned features, it was capable of sharing the data to a WhatsApp contact.
